*********************About CreditList.py****************************

CreditList.py is a small program I wrote which will automatically download information from specific websites (a website contain 50 pages of lists of dishonest people in this case) and organize them into the data format I want.


See °CreditList_SampleResult.png’ to find some of my crawling results.


*********************About search.py****************************

This program take user’s keyboard input (a Chinese name) as parameter and search this person to see if he/she has dishonest record. It will all results collected form the websites(If there are two person who have the same name, this program creates two result file).
